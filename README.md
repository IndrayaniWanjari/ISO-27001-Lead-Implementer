# 🛡️ ISO/IEC 27001 Lead Implementer – Cybersecurity Learning Portfolio

This repository serves as a structured, clause-by-clause **learning archive and practical implementation guide** for ISO/IEC 27001:2022. Each module includes my interpretation of the standard, implementation strategies, real-world examples, and personal reflections — all of which are intended to demonstrate my technical and strategic understanding of building a compliant and effective ISMS.

## 🧠 What Is ISO/IEC 27001?

**ISO/IEC 27001** is the international standard for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an **Information Security Management System (ISMS)**. Published by **ISO and IEC**, this standard enables organizations to manage sensitive information systematically and securely.

The framework is designed to:
- Ensure **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **availability** of information
- Reduce risk through a formalized and repeatable **risk treatment process**
- Establish a security culture supported by top management
- Align with **legal**, **regulatory**, and **contractual** obligations

ISO 27001 is not just about compliance — it's about making security a core part of the business process.

## 💼 About Me

I’m **Indrayani Wanjari**, a graduate student specializing in **Cybersecurity** at the **National University of Singapore (NUS)**. I created this repository to bridge the gap between theoretical learning and practical application — and to build a public portfolio that showcases my growing expertise in:

- Information Security Governance (ISO 27001, NIST CSF)
- Risk Management
- Security Compliance (GRC)
- Internal Audits & Process Improvement

I believe cybersecurity is not just about defense — it's about trust, responsibility, continual learning and improvement.
