# Module 05 â€“ The Check and Act Phase

> **Summary**: This module corresponds to the Check and Act stages of the PDCA cycle. It covers how an organization evaluates ISMS performance, identifies nonconformities, and ensures continual improvement through documented actions.

---

## Overview of the Module

The **Check Phase** evaluates whether the Information Security Management System (ISMS) is working as intended by collecting performance data, conducting audits, and reviewing controls.  
The **Act Phase** focuses on addressing nonconformities, implementing corrective actions, and improving the ISMS based on real-world performance.
